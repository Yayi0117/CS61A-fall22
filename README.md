Welcome to the CS61A Fall 2022 repository! This repository contains my implementations of the homework, labs, and projects for the CS61A course offered in Fall 2022. The course focuses on the principles of computer science using Python, and this repository serves as a record of my learning journey and progress throughout the semester.
